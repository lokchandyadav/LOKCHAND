   1. BARAGAINED CHARACTERS

    #Controls and data structures-->ABC language

    #Strings and its format -->from c

    #Regular expressions --> Pearl

    #Exception handling --> Module 3

    #Magic mrthods from --> fortron
    
  
   2. What kind of language is pthon

    #python is a

    #> object oriented programming language
    #> Dynamically typed language
    #> Scripting language
    #> Interpreted language
    #> Compiled language
    #> Functional programming language

   3. Flavours of python
    
    #> Cpython-Written in c, Most common implementation of python
    
    #> Jython- java implementation in python
    
    #> Ironpython- Implementation of the python programming language which is tightly integrated with NET
    
    #> Brython- Browser Python, runs in browsers
    
    #> RubyPython- Bridge between python and Ruby Interpreters
    
    #> Micropython- Runs in Micro controllers


    4.Print has 5 parameters
    
    #Object
    #sep
    #end
    #file
    #flush
    
     #>object
     #-->the value to be printed is object
     
     #>sep-->seperator
     
     #Example
     #a=9
     #b=8
     #c=89
     #print(a,b,c, sep='$')
     
     #>end-->which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
      #It will not keep the command to saty in same line

      #Example
      #print(str(a), b, end='%%')
      #print(str(c))
     
     

      !Variables--->

  #?variable is a name which is used to identify the value of variable
  #?which is stored in a specific memory location    
   
    !Rules to define variables

  # 1.) Variables have to start with only alphabets,underscores
  # 2.) The character following the 1st character can be alphabets,numbers,underscores
  # 3.) No spaces are allowed
  # 4.) No special characters like !@#$%^&*()+
  # 5.) Case sensitive
  # 6.) Keywords are not allowed as variables

    # ! ways to define variables

    #a = 8
    #b = 9
    #print(a, b)
                                      
   #a=7, b=9 #error
    #print(a)
    #print(b)

    #a=7
    #b=7

    # a = b =7
    #print(a, b)

    #a=8, 7,9.89, "hello"
    #print(a)
    #print(type(a))

    #a,b = 78 #error
    #print(a, b)
